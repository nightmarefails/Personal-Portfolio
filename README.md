# Personal Portfolio

## Project Details
This project was completed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Using Semantic HTML and more advanced CSS properties like flex-box and media queries I was assigned to make a webpage that was responsive to different device types and screen.

The website was styled using the UIKit CSS Framwork.

I also wanted to demonstrate my ability to use API's so I used the github api to pull in my projects and dynamically created the cards with JavaScript. Now When I add more repos they will also show up on the site. All I will need to do is add an image and a description to the JavaScript code for the website.
