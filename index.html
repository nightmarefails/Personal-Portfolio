                <p>
                    My name is Harrison Armstrong and I am a family man with a wife and two kids. We are currently expecting a third child as well. 
                    I currently live in central Michigan and enjoy spending time with my family and all things technology.
 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am mostly self taught at this point in time, but I am currently taking a Full Stack Web-Dev bootcamp from MSU. I also am expecting a certificate
                    in Java Programming at the end of this summer term from Wilmington University. I have basic knowledge of Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                </p>
