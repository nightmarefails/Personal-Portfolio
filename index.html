                        My name is Harrison Armstrong and I am a family man with a wife and two kids. We are currently expecting a third child as well. 
                        I currently live in central Michigan.

                        I am mostly self taught at this point in time, but I am currently taking a Full Stack Web-Dev bootcamp from MSU. I also am expecting a certificate
                        in Java Programming at the end of this summer term from Wilmington University. I have basic knowledge of Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    </p>

                        My hobbies are anything technology related. I enjoy tinkering with my homelab server and playing games with my friends online. I also enjoy camping, fishing, 
                        and enjoying time with my family.
